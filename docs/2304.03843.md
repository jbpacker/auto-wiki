## A Unified Framework for Data Valuation and Pricing\n\n**Authors:** Yiding Chen, Jian Lou, Jianwei Huang\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-01\n\n**Link:** [A Unified Framework for Data Valuation and Pricing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03843.pdf)\n\n**Summary:** This paper presents a unified framework for data valuation and pricing, which aims to provide a systematic approach to quantify the value of data and determine its price. The authors propose a general data valuation function and a data pricing mechanism based on the Shapley value. They also discuss various factors affecting data valuation and pricing, such as data quality, data quantity, and data complementarity.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n1. The paper presents a unified framework for data valuation and pricing.\n2. The authors propose a general data valuation function and a data pricing mechanism based on the Shapley value.\n3. The framework considers various factors affecting data valuation and pricing, such as data quality, data quantity, and data complementarity.\n4. The proposed framework can be applied to various data markets and has potential real-world applications.
