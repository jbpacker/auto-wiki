## [Reflexion](Reflexion.md)
Reflexion is an approach that endows an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities. The agent is equipped with a heuristic function to detect common modes of failure and utilizes self-optimization grounded in natural language. Reflexion is tested on the AlfWorld text-based benchmark and the HotPotQA question-answering benchmark, resulting in improved performance in decision-making and knowledge-intensive tasks.
