**Summary:** This document investigates AI alignment techniques for large language models, focusing on ensuring helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. The research explores the effects of prompting, the scaling of imitation learning vs. preference modeling, and the use of preference model pre-training. The findings reveal that "preference modeling outperforms and scales better than imitation learning," and that "preference model pre-training significantly improves sample efficiency."
