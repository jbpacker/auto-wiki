## CAMEL: Communicative Agents for 'Mind' Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society\n\n**Authors:** Guohao Li, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Hani Itani, Dmitrii Khizbullin, Bernard Ghanem\n\n**Link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760)\n\n**Summary:** The rapid advancement of conversational and chat-based language models has led to remarkable progress in complex task-solving. However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper introduces a novel communicative agent framework named CAMEL (Communicative Agents for 'Mind' Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society) that uses inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. Role-playing is proposed as a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems. The project's GitHub repository is publicly available, supporting research on communicative agents and beyond.
